module HTree exposing (fromList, tagWithDepth, toList, toOutline, depth, nodeCount)

{-|

Convert hierarchical lists to a rose tree,
convert a rose tree to a list of node labels,
convert a rose tree to a string representing the
corresponding outline, etc. See HTreeExample.elm.

{-|  Suppose give an list of items of type `a`, a "root" element
of type `a`, and a function that determines the level of an item.
The function `fromList` returns  the corresponding rose tree.
For an example, consider the outline given by the string
`Example.Test.o3:

    A
      p
        1
        2
        3
      q
    B
      r
      s
    C

Then we have

    > import HTree exposing(..)
    > import HTree.String as HS
    > import Example.Test as Example

    > data = String.split "\n" o2 |> List.filter (\line -> line /= "")
    ["A","  p","  q","B","  r","  s","C"]
        : List String

    > t = fromList "*" HS.level data
    Tree "*"
       [Tree "A" [Tree ("  p") [],Tree ("  q") []]
       ,Tree "B" [Tree ("  r") [],Tree ("  s") []]
       ,Tree "C" []]

The function `HS.level` returns the number of leading spaces divided by 2 --
integer division, no remainder.
